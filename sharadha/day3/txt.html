    Mumbai—the city that never sleeps.Tall buildings stretched toward the sky,
    their glass facades reflecting the blazing sun,while crowded streets below 
    carried an endless tide of people, buses, and rickshaws.The smell of street 
    food mixed with the salty breeze of the Arabian sea.

    Every corner of the city told a story — some of hope, some of heartbreak, and all of relentless energy.
    Niyati sat on a worn wooden bench in a small garden tucked between two busy lanes. 
    The sun was warm on her face, and for a moment, the city noise felt distant, almost muted.
    She watched a young college couple sitting on the grass nearby, laughing together.
